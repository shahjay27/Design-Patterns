# Design-Patterns
Builder Pattern : Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. 
Factory Pattern : Factory pattern seperates object construction code from that actually using the object. It is used when the type of object creation is to be decided at run-time (based on some business logic).
Prototype Pattern : The Prototype pattern delegates the object cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned.
